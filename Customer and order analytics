In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

1) How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT count(orderid) 
FROM BIT.JanSales 
WHERE orderid IS NOT NULL
AND orderid <> '';

2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT count (orderid) 
FROM BIT.JanSales 
WHERE product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order_ID';

3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT.customers cust 

INNER JOIN BIT.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order_ID';

4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT.JanSales 
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1; 

5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;

6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
sum(quantity),
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY product;

7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
